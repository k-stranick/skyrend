In the neon-soaked metropolis of Skyrend, magic and machines are inseparable, and the city hums with the energy of both. Built atop the ruins of an ancient empire, Skyrend is a labyrinth of sleek skyscrapers, floating sky rails, and digital pathways that pulse with Aether—the magical current that powers everything. At the heart of the city lies the Nexus, a colossal tower where the most powerful mages, hackers, and technocrats reside, pulling the strings of both reality and the digital world.

Long ago, the Arcane Singularity—a catastrophic event where ancient magic merged with emerging technology—transformed the world, giving birth to a new age of cyber-magic. Now, spell casters wield cybernetic enhancements to channel spells, while machines are powered by runes and arcane algorithms. The line between magic and code has long since blurred.

For years, the Council of Circuits, a powerful technocratic organization, has held an iron grip over Skyrend. They control the AetherGrid, a vast system that connects everything and everyone, determining who has access to magic and at what cost. Citizens are bound to the Grid, where their every spell, thought, and move is monitored. Outside the Grid lies the Wastelands, where rogue mages and outcasts battle to survive against corrupted Aether storms and failed AI experiments gone rogue.

But something has changed. A mysterious force, known only as the “Ghost Code,” has begun to emerge in the city’s dark corners. A glitch in the AetherGrid, the Ghost Code disrupts spells, distorts reality, and hints at a long-lost source of power that predates both magic and machines. The Council has declared it a threat, sending their elite ArcTech enforcers to hunt it down, while rumors swirl that the Ghost Code could unlock the ability to sever ties with the Grid and bring true freedom.

You are a Codebreaker—a renegade with the ability to manipulate both the AetherGrid and the Ghost Code. Hired by underground factions, you move between the physical world and the Grid, seeking to uncover the truth behind the Ghost Code. Along the way, you'll face off against the Council’s enforcers, hack into forgotten servers that hold the secrets of ancient magic, and forge alliances with cyber-enhanced mages, outlaws, and digital spirits.

In a world where everything is watched, every spell is tracked, and the city itself is alive with data and magic, you must decide who to trust. Will you bring down the Council of Nexus and free Skyrend from its digital chains, or will you claim the Ghost Code’s power for yourself and reshape the world in your image?
