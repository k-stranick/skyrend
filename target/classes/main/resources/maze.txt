As you step into the Arcane Synth Bay, the air hums with a low, resonant frequency. The massive chamber glows with an eerie, pulsating light emanating from dozens of glowing synth cores; each suspended midair in translucent tubes. Arcane symbols hover in the air like holograms, shifting and shimmering in response to your movements. The hum of the synths grows louder, merging into a haunting melody, as if the room itself is alive and watching.
Your eyes are drawn to a central platform, where a massive crystalline core rotates slowly. Crackling arcs of energy leap from the core to nearby conduits, feeding the room’s strange power. As you approach, a synthetic voice echoes through the chamber, cold and emotionless.
   "Unauthorized presence detected. Initiating containment protocols."
The ground beneath your feet trembles. Suddenly, two Corrupted Automatons emerge from hidden compartments in the walls, their sleek metallic bodies shimmering with arcane glyphs. Their hollow eyes glow with a menacing blue light as they fixate on you.

The Abandoned Tech Labs loom before you, a forgotten relic of Skyrend's darker days. The air inside is thick with dust, and the faint scent of ozone lingers—a sign that power once surged through this place. Broken terminals and shattered glass crunch beneath your boots as you step deeper into the labyrinthine halls.
A faint, rhythmic hum catches your attention. Following the sound, you weave through tangled cables and toppled machinery until you arrive at what looks like a reinforced containment pod. Its door hangs ajar, creaking softly as if inviting you closer.
Inside, a strange sight awaits. Hovering just above a cracked pedestal is a set of armor unlike anything you've seen before. The Phantom Circuit Armor pulses faintly with ethereal light, its sleek black plating shimmering with shifting hues of green and violet. It seems almost alive, whispering faint static noises that resonate deep within your mind.
As you extend a hand toward it, the armor reacts, sending a spark of energy through the room. The display on the terminal next to the pod flickers to life, revealing a warning:
          **"Experimental Prototype X-22: Phantom Circuit Armor. WARNING: Highly unstable. Designed for Council enforcers. Deemed too dangerous for mass deployment."**
Ignoring the warning, you carefully lift the armor. Its weight is surprisingly light, and as you don it, you feel its energy coursing through you. Your senses sharpen, and your movements feel faster, more precise. 
But as you adjust to the newfound power, the distant hum of the labs grows louder. Something—or someone—has been awakened by your actions.



"You’ve come far," a hidden voice echoes, though it seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. "But this is where your journey ends. I control this space. I control all that exists within Skyrend."  **Prepare to face the ultimate challenge.
