i uise the other code i exit right after I attack&#10;&#10;fixed issue of re-instantiating player a second time when maze is created&#10;&#10;currently runs but I am facing issues where turns will still execute even after death.&#10;need to still refactor turn based fight logic.&#10;&#10;refactored the turn based logic, able to implement random encounters, flushed out classes implementing logging&#10;&#10;added monsters and bosses, fixed repeating special event logic, fixed special events maybe implement leveling up or just increase stats for the time being&#10;&#10;&#10;working&#10;&#10;&#10;added search items, added better random logic fixed class cast exception error, created weapons, items, special boss, need to flush out story need to add to PlayerActions equip and unequip methods&#10;there are issues where I can access rooms that were not accessible before but i never changed the movement logic so why is this?? &#10;did a bunch of stuff but i need to polish this game&#10;&#10;MOVEMENT is now kind of broken will pull new branch and debug\">\r\n      <change beforePath=\"$PROJECT_DIR$/.idea/workspace.xml\" beforeDir=\"false\"
